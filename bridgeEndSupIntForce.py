#Program to calculate the supports on the end of a bridge, for engineering class. Assumes many things, including all forces are vertical only, and all support is exactly at the end of a rigid structure, and all support lies at points on the ends of the structure.

import math

#Give summary/description of program and assumptions
input ("Assume all trusses are made of equillateral triangles, and that the bridge\'s entire weight is concentrated at one point at the middle.\nThis program will ask you to specify the length of the bridge, the weight of the bridge, the amount of additional applied force, and the additional force's distance from the point which you are using as the center of the moment. The prompts will specify which units to enter your numerical values as.\nPress ENTER to continue.")
input ("Dont type in commas, and dont expect place value commas in your outputs, because I\'m a noob, lol.\nPress ENTER to continue")
